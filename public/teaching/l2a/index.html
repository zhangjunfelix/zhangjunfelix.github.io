<p>This course is a general introduction to scientific research into how people learn a second language. Although the course is designed to be accessible to students from a wide variety of backgrounds, some knowledge of the linguistic structure of English will be assumed.</p>
<p>Second language acquisition, or SLA, is a theoretical and experimental field of study which, like first language acquisition studies, looks at the phenomenon of language development &ndash; in this case the acquisition of a second language.</p>
<p>The dominant aim behind the research of this field is to extend our understanding of the complex processes and mechanisms that drive language acquisition.</p>
<hr>
<p>By virtue of the fact that language itself is complex, SLA has become a broadly-based field and it now involves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Examining how non-native language ability develops, stabilizes, and undergoes attrition (forgetting, loss)</li>
<li>Carrying out an analysis and interpretation of all aspects of learner language with the help of current linguistic theory</li>
<li>Developing theories that are specific to the field of SLA that aim to account for the many facets of non-native language and behavior</li>
<li>Testing hypotheses to explain second language knowledge and behavior</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4 id="learning-objectives"><em>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</em><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#learning-objectives">#</a></h4>
<p>By the end of the course, students should be able to:<br>
[1].	Identify major issues in current SLA research and theory<br>
[2].	Discuss problems and challenges in current research and theory<br>
[3].	Describe how the field developed historically, including major trends in research/theories, major figures <br>
[4].	Summarize the important studies and basic ideas of research studies<br>
[5].	Formulate questions about aspects of research articles and theories that you do not understand<br>
[6].	Analyze second language learner data from multiple perspectives<br>
[7].	Articulate your own stand on theories of SLA (develop your own theory) and describe the principles that will inform your future work in the field</p>
