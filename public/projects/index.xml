      <description>&lt;p&gt;Given my view of languages as an critical part of human cognition, I would like to know more about the nature of this cognitive capability that seems to be only possessed by humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a continuation of my research on language acquisition, I started to realize that, fascinating as linguistic competence may be, ignoring linguistic performance is not reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After working on topics of non-native language processing, especially disambiguation, I ventered into pragmatic inferencing (mostly due to failure to produce any publication &amp;#x1f615; &amp;#x1f62d; &amp;#x1f61e; &amp;#x1f631; ).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2. language acquisition</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a learner of English as a foreign language since age 13, I naturally wonder how my English always come short of native-like competence. Such curiosity drives me, as a linguist, further to investigate issues in non-native language acquisition and conduct research on these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a link to my master&amp;rsquo;s thesis.

&lt;p&gt;While I was studying for my Ph.D., I expanded my interest into the area of first language acquisition as I was working on how syntactic knowledge was acquired.
Here is a link to my Ph.D. disseration. &lt;a href=&#34;https://scholars.hkbu.edu.hk/en/studentTheses/scope-interaction-between-universal-quantifiers-and-sentential-ne&#34;&gt;Link to fulltext&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
