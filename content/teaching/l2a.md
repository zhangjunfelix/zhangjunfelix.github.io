### 🎓 My Second Language acquisition courses  

I currently offer two specialized courses on second language acquisition, tailored to different academic levels:  



#### 🎒 Undergraduate Level  
*Introduction to Second Language Acquisition*  
A foundational course covering core concepts in SLA for undergraduate students.  

#### 🎓 Graduate Level  
*Advanced Introduction to Second Language Acquisition*  
An in-depth exploration of SLA theories and research for graduate students, with a focus on the perspective from generative linguistics.

#### *COURSE DESCRIPTION* ####
This course is a general introduction to scientific research into how people learn a second language. Although the course is designed to be accessible to students from a wide variety of backgrounds, some knowledge of the linguistic structure of English will be assumed.

Second language acquisition, or SLA, is a theoretical and experimental field of study which, like first language acquisition studies, looks at the phenomenon of language development -- in this case the acquisition of a second language. 

The dominant aim behind the research of this field is to extend our understanding of the complex processes and mechanisms that drive language acquisition. 

---

By virtue of the fact that language itself is complex, SLA has become a broadly-based field and it now involves:
- Examining how non-native language ability develops, stabilizes, and undergoes attrition (forgetting, loss)
- Carrying out an analysis and interpretation of all aspects of learner language with the help of current linguistic theory
- Developing theories that are specific to the field of SLA that aim to account for the many facets of non-native language and behavior
- Testing hypotheses to explain second language knowledge and behavior

#### *LEARNING OBJECTIVES* ####
By the end of the course, students should be able to:  
[1].	Identify major issues in current SLA research and theory  
[2].	Discuss problems and challenges in current research and theory  
[3].	Describe how the field developed historically, including major trends in research/theories, major figures    
[4].	Summarize the important studies and basic ideas of research studies  
[5].	Formulate questions about aspects of research articles and theories that you do not understand  
[6].	Analyze second language learner data from multiple perspectives  
[7].	Articulate your own stand on theories of SLA (develop your own theory) and describe the principles that will inform your future work in the field
